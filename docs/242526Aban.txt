To whom it may concern,

The three preceding days will be a series of spectacular gatherings of the peoples of Iran in the streets of Tehran - the capital.

They are beyond angry since the death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of a brutal dictatorship.  Mahsa’s murder was the spark that ignited the kindling in people’s souls.

These are not demonstrations.  They are not protests.  This is a stage in a revolution.

I write to you and your organization in the hopes that you will bring these days to light and not  sweep these people’s lives under the rug.  These are brave and courageous women, men, and children taking the ultimate risk against their oppressors and torturers.

In our calendar, this will be taking place over November 15th, 16th, and 17th.

Again, please bring this great event to your organization’s reach.

Regards,

Supporters of a Free Iran.
